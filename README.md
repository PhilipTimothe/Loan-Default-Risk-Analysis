# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Loan default is a significant issue in the finance industry, costing billions annually.
This project aims to build a **predictive model** that identifies high-risk borrowers and recommends **data-driven strategies** to minimize loan defaults.

## Business Objectives

- Identify key factors influencing loan defaults.
- Predict default risk using machine learning models.
- Recommend approval strategies for financial institutions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and querying)
- **Power BI/Tableau** (for interactive dashboards)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for EDA and modeling)
- **GitHub Actions** (for workflow automation)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `data/` â€“ Source data files (cleaned datasets are stored here)
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks for EDA and ML models
- `reports/` â€“ Business insights and final recommendations
- `src/` â€“ Python scripts for data processing and model training
- `dashboards/` â€“ Power BI or Tableau dashboards

## EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis

### Distribution of Credit Limits

- Most customers have credit limits **below $200,000**, with a **right-skewed distribution**.
- Higher credit limits may indicate **lower risk**, while low credit customers may have **higher default rates**.

### Repayment Status Over Time

- Customers with **delayed payments in earlier months** tend to continue **defaulting**.
- Many **outliers (dots)** represent **chronic late payers**, indicating **high-risk borrowers**.
- Financial institutions should **intervene early** when a customer **misses a payment**.
