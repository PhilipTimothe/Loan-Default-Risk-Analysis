# Loan Default Risk Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Loan default is a significant issue in the finance industry, costing billions annually.
This project aims to build a **predictive model** that identifies high-risk borrowers and recommends **data-driven strategies** to minimize loan defaults.

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Objectives

- Identify key factors influencing loan defaults.
- Predict default risk using machine learning models.
- Recommend approval strategies for financial institutions.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and querying)
- **Power BI/Tableau** (for interactive dashboards)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for EDA and modeling)
- **GitHub Actions** (for workflow automation)

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `data/` â€“ Source data files (cleaned datasets are stored here)
- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks for EDA and ML models
- `reports/` â€“ Business insights and final recommendations
- `src/` â€“ Python scripts for data processing and model training
- `dashboards/` â€“ Power BI or Tableau dashboards

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights (To Be Updated)

- Early EDA shows that **low credit scores and high debt-to-income ratios** significantly increase default risk.
- Logistic Regression currently achieves **80% accuracy** in predicting defaults.

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

- Fine-tune models to improve precision.
- Deploy an interactive dashboard for loan officers.
- Expand dataset with real-time lending data.
